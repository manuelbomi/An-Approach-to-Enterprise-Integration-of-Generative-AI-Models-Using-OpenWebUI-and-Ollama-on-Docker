In this discourse, we will show (using infographs) how to use Lucidchart to architect an e-commerce database comprising of four tables viz: customers, products, orders and order_details tables.

We shall then show how to use Lucidchart to translate the e-commerce ERD to a database by using Lucidchart to automatically generate SQL codes for MSSQL Server database.

> MSSQL Server database Implementation

```ruby
'CREATE TABLE [customers] (
  [customer_id] INT ,
  [last_name] VARCHAR(255),
  [first_name] VARCHAR(255),
  [phone_nos] VARCHAR(20),
  [email] VARCHAR(255),
  [street] VARCHAR(255),
  [city] VARCHAR(255),
  [zip] VARCHAR(255),
  [is_active] BOOLEAN,
  PRIMARY KEY ([customer_id])
);

CREATE TABLE [product] (
  [product_id] INT,
  [product_name] VARCHAR(255),
  [price] DECIMAL,
  PRIMARY KEY ([product_id])
);

CREATE TABLE [orders] (
  [id] INT,
  [customer_id] INT,
  [date] DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY ([id]),
  CONSTRAINT [FK_orders.customer_id]
    FOREIGN KEY ([customer_id])
      REFERENCES [customers]([customer_id])
);

CREATE TABLE [order_details] (
  [id] INT,
  [order_id] INT,
  [product_id] INT,
  [quantity] INT,
  [price] DECIMAL(12, 2),
  [to_street] VARCHAR(255),
  [to_city] VARCHAR(255),
  [to_zip] VARCHAR(255),
  [ship_date] varchar,
  PRIMARY KEY ([id]),
  CONSTRAINT [FK_order_details.product_id]
    FOREIGN KEY ([product_id])
      REFERENCES [product]([product_id]),
  CONSTRAINT [FK_order_details.order_id]
    FOREIGN KEY ([order_id])
      REFERENCES [orders]([id])
);


```
